Terraform Azure Infrastructure
This repository contains Terraform code for setting up essential infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, such as a Resource Group, Virtual Network, and other services.

Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Terraform (v1.x or later)
An active Azure subscription
Azure CLI for authentication
Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Configure your Azure credentials

You can log in to Azure using the Azure CLI:

bash
Copy code
az login
Initialize Terraform

Terraform uses modules and plugins that need to be initialized. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Customize Variables (Optional)

If your configuration includes variables, create a terraform.tfvars file or modify the default values in the main.tf file. For example, to change the location or resource names, update the values accordingly.

Apply the Configuration

To create the infrastructure on Azure, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action. Type yes to proceed.

Review the Infrastructure

After the deployment, you can verify the infrastructure in the Azure portal or use the Azure CLI to check the status:

bash
Copy code
az group show --name aks-resource-group
Resources Created
This configuration sets up the following Azure resources:

Resource Group: aks-resource-group in the East US region.
Virtual Network: aks-vnet with the address space 10.0.0.0/16.
Additional resources may be configured in the main.tf file based on your infrastructure needs.

Cleanup
To remove the infrastructure, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
This will delete all resources that were created by this Terraform configuration.

Notes
Ensure that your Azure subscription has sufficient quotas and permissions to create the resources defined.
This configuration can be customized to suit your specific infrastructure requirements by modifying the main.tf file.

├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── README.md
└── modules/
    ├── data_factory/
    │   └── main.tf
    └── databricks/
        └── main.tf
```

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0.0 or newer)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An Azure subscription

## Configuration

The main configuration is defined in `main.tf`. It sets up:

- An Azure Resource Group
- An Azure Data Factory (using a custom module)
- An Azure Databricks workspace (using a custom module)

You can customize the deployment by modifying the variables in `variables.tf`. The default values are:

- Resource Group: `rg-clouddatadevops-001`
- Location: `East US`
- Data Factory: `adf-clouddatadevops-001`
- Databricks Workspace: `dbw-clouddatadevops-001`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd clouddatadevops-terraform
   ```

2. Log in to Azure:
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review the planned changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

6. When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the creation of the resources.

## Outputs

After successful application, Terraform will output:

- The Resource Group ID
- The Data Factory ID
- The Databricks Workspace URL

You can view these outputs at any time by running:
```
terraform output
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove all resources created by this Terraform configuration:

```
terraform destroy
```

**Caution**: This will permanently delete all resources managed by this Terraform configuration. Make sure you really want to do this before confirming.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

# Azure SQL Server and Database Terraform Configuration

This Terraform configuration sets up an Azure SQL Server and Database for the CloudDevopsHQ project.

## Resources Created

- Azure Resource Group
- Azure SQL Server
- Azure SQL Database

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version 0.12.x or later)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An Azure subscription

## Configuration

1. Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and you're logged in:

   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Select the appropriate subscription:

   ```
   az account set --subscription "606e824b-aaf7-4b4e-9057-b459f6a4436d"
   ```

3. Update the `azure-sql-infrastructure.tf` file if you need to change any settings such as resource names, locations, or SQL administrator credentials.

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

2. Preview the changes:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to create the resources.

4. After successful creation, Terraform will output the names of the created SQL Server and Database.

## Clean Up

To remove all created resources:

```
terraform destroy
```

Type `yes` when prompted to destroy the resources.

## Security Considerations

- The SQL Server administrator password is stored in plain text in the Terraform file. For production use, consider using Azure Key Vault or environment variables to manage sensitive information.
- The configuration creates a public SQL Server. For production environments, consider implementing additional security measures such as firewalls and virtual networks.

## Customization

You can modify the `azure-sql-infrastructure.tf` file to change:

- Resource names
- Azure region
- SQL Server version
- Database SKU
- Tags

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're logged in to the correct Azure subscription.
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions to create resources.
3. Verify that the resource names are unique across Azure.

For more detailed error messages, you can set the `TF_LOG` environment variable:

```
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
```

# Terraform Azure VM Deployment

This Terraform project deploys multiple virtual machines in Microsoft Azure along with the necessary networking infrastructure.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.tf`: Main Terraform configuration file
- `variables.tf`: Variable definitions
- `outputs.tf`: Output definitions
- `terraform.tfvars`: Variable values

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed (version ~> 2.65)
- An Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Review and modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your deployment. Be sure to change the `admin_password` to a secure value.

## Deployment

To deploy the infrastructure:

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

2. Review the planned changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

4. When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the deployment.

## Resources Created

This Terraform configuration creates the following resources:

- 1 Resource Group
- 1 Virtual Network with 1 Subnet
- 4 Virtual Machines
- Associated network interfaces and public IP addresses

## Modules

The project uses two modules:

1. `network`: Creates the virtual network and subnet
2. `vm`: Creates virtual machines (used in a loop to create multiple VMs)

## Outputs

After a successful deployment, Terraform will output the following information:

- VM IDs
- Public IPs of the VMs

## Variables

Key variables that can be configured in `terraform.tfvars`:

- `resource_group_name`: Name of the resource group
- `location`: Azure region for resource deployment
- `vnet_name`: Name of the virtual network
- `vnet_address_space`: Address space for the virtual network
- `subnet_name`: Name of the subnet
- `subnet_prefixes`: Address prefixes for the subnet
- `vm_name_prefix`: Prefix for VM names
- `admin_username`: Admin username for VMs
- `admin_password`: Admin password for VMs (sensitive)

## Clean Up

To destroy the created resources and avoid unnecessary costs:

```
terraform destroy
```

When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the deletion of resources.

## Security Note

Remember to keep your `terraform.tfvars` file secure and never commit it to version control with sensitive information like passwords. Consider using Azure Key Vault or environment variables for managing sensitive data in production environments.
