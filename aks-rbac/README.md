Terraform Azure Infrastructure
This repository contains Terraform code for setting up essential infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, such as a Resource Group, Virtual Network, and other services.

Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Terraform (v1.x or later)
An active Azure subscription
Azure CLI for authentication
Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Configure your Azure credentials

You can log in to Azure using the Azure CLI:

bash
Copy code
az login
Initialize Terraform

Terraform uses modules and plugins that need to be initialized. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Customize Variables (Optional)

If your configuration includes variables, create a terraform.tfvars file or modify the default values in the main.tf file. For example, to change the location or resource names, update the values accordingly.

Apply the Configuration

To create the infrastructure on Azure, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action. Type yes to proceed.

Review the Infrastructure

After the deployment, you can verify the infrastructure in the Azure portal or use the Azure CLI to check the status:

bash
Copy code
az group show --name aks-resource-group
Resources Created
This configuration sets up the following Azure resources:

Resource Group: aks-resource-group in the East US region.
Virtual Network: aks-vnet with the address space 10.0.0.0/16.
Additional resources may be configured in the main.tf file based on your infrastructure needs.

Cleanup
To remove the infrastructure, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
This will delete all resources that were created by this Terraform configuration.

Notes
Ensure that your Azure subscription has sufficient quotas and permissions to create the resources defined.
This configuration can be customized to suit your specific infrastructure requirements by modifying the main.tf file.
